# 1.ValidExpression
For this project i tried to test the different strings with different conditions
rather than writing a unique complex regex.
I assumed, not being in the test cases that i only had to test on integers or
trigonometric expressions.

# 2.EvaluateExpression
Assuming that the expression was valid, i firstly converted the possible
trigonometric expressions to js friendly expressions and then turned the whole
string to a mathemathical expression (without using eval).

# 3.Calculator
I worked on disabling the button and showing the helper (if the expression
is invalid).
I emptyed the input after each btn click.
I am showing the results top-bottom from the newest to the oldest removing this
one when the expressions are more than five.
I used the existing files from the previous exercises for validations and
evaluations.

# 4.SuprCalculator
For the first part i simply fetched the number coming from the server and used
it as input for the random fn as required
For the second part i referred to a tutorial (https://dev.to/javascriptacademy/create-a-simple-calculator-using-html-css-and-javascript-4o7k ) for exercise's sake.
Then i slightly edit it for the result's calculation.
